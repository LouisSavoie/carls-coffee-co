# Carl's Coffee Co.

"It's coffee... drink it."

## About

Starting in his home kitchen when he was 25 years old, Carl has always roasted his own blend of hand-selected triple origin beans in small batches the same way for over 30 years. When you come to his modest "coffee shack", as he calls it, he will brew the delicious blend right in front of you, cup by cup to ensure a wonderful and consistent beverage every time.

All of this sounds very fancy since Carl has taken great care in perfecting the coffee-making process in order to deliver a brew that he personally enjoys, although now that the formula has been worked out and the fuss is over...

Carl modestly says, "It's coffee... drink it."
