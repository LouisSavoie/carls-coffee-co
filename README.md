# Carl's Coffee Co.

## About

Starting in his home kitchen when he was 25 years old, Carl has always roasted his own blend of hand-selected triple origin beans in small batches the same way for over 30 years. When you come to his modest "coffee shack", as he calls it, he will brew the delicious blend right in front of you, cup by cup to ensure a wonderful and consistent beverage every time.
